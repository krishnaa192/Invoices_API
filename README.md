# Invoices_API
Create a Django application (Django Rest Framework) using the given information: Create two Django models viz. Invoice and Invoice Detail. Invoice model fields -> Date, Invoice No, Customer Name. Invoice Detail model fields -> invoice (Foreign Key), description, quantity, unit price, price. Create APIs for the get and post endpoints for the Invoice model (Hint: You can use Model View sets and Model Serializer to make your job easier) The API should also accept invoice details in the payload and create the associated invoice details too (Hint: You need to create a nested Serializer to accomplish this) Bonus Task (Not mandatory): Create test cases to test all the API endpoints.
